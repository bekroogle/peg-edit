# pegedit

## About
Pegedit is a web-based development environment for designing PEG grammars (yes, I know that's redundant). It combines [Ace source code editors](http://ace.c9.io) for input with [PEG.js](http://pegjs.org) to generate the parsers and [D3.js](http://d3js.org) to help visualize your parse trees.

## To use
Visit the website at http://pegedit.cspotrun.org. While I'll do my best to keep the site updated, I don't have any kind of clever build system that deploys my commits, so this repository will always be the place to go for the latest, most authoritative versions.

The [wiki](http://github.com/bekroogle/pegedit/wiki) has some details on building this site from source and should soon contain some decent user information. While the site did have a nice [Joyride](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/joyride.html) walk-through, the UI has changed so much as to make the tips no longer fit.
