%h4 "C Spot Run!"

  %p
    For our first trick, we're gonna make the phrase "C Spot Run!" appear on the computer screen.
  %p
    In the code editor on the right, enter the following:
    %blockquote
      %kbd
        print "C Spot Run!"

  %p
    Then press the
    %kbd Parse
    button at the top of the screen.
  %p ... and voil&agrave;! If you look at the space below the code editor,you'll notice that the computer did exactly what you told it to. Maybe it deserves a treat?

  %p
    Go ahead. Teach this dog a new trick... it's still young, you know.

  This is a pre-alpha version of c.run. In other words, it isn't done. It's not ready to be used as a tool for teaching students. For self-study, be aware that features remain unimplemented and the c.run language still undergoes breaking changes often (we're still changing our minds on how it goes).
